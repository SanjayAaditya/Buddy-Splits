# Buddy Splits

Buddy Splits is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of splitting payments among friends. Whether youâ€™re dining out or sharing expenses for a group activity, Buddy Splits simplifies tracking and managing payments by generating UPI links and retrieving contact details.

## UPDATE
- The application is in development. There is no GUI as of now. I am learning KOTLIN to try to create an android app. Feel free to try the python scripts. If you are willing to contribute go right on ahead.
