# Buddy Splits

Buddy Splits is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of splitting payments among friends. Whether youâ€™re dining out or sharing expenses for a group activity, Buddy Splits simplifies tracking and managing payments by generating UPI links and retrieving contact details.

## Usage
- You need to setup your google api integration and download "client_secret.json" from google cloud platform. Place it in the same directory along with the scripts. Run the contactExtractor.py file first then the contactParser.py.
- You may need to add yourself and your team members as test users for them to allow access.

## UPDATE
- The application is in development. There is no GUI as of now. I am learning KOTLIN to try to create an android app. Feel free to try the python scripts. If you are willing to contribute go right on ahead.
